## Description

``Claude`` **can delegate tasks to subagents that break them down and run component tasks in parallel, improving your** ``context management``. Each _subagent_ operates in its own isolated context window.

## Details

``Managing context`` in ``Claude Code`` is important. A lot of the ``context window`` gets consumed by things like tool calls exploring your codebase or running web searches for research. What ``Claude`` discovers during that exploration isn't always relevant to the main feature you're developing.

This is where _subagents_ come in. ``Claude`` spawns a subagent to handle a task like "explore this codebase for me." The _subagent_ runs in parallel with its own ``context window``, does all the exploration work, and once finished, summarizes its findings and returns that summary back to ``Claude``.

The result: **you get the answer you were looking for, without the entire journey it took to get there cluttering your main context**.


### Creating Your Own Subagent

Subagents are defined in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. The easiest way to get started is to let Claude generate one for you. Run:

```bash title:bash
$ /agents
```

Then select "Create new agent." You'll walk through steps including choosing the scope of the agent, defining its purpose, selecting the tools it has access to, and even picking a color for it.

Claude will generate a name, description, and prompt for the subagent. This also tells Claude when to call the subagent based on the prompts you give it.

## Further Customization

Subagents can be customized further. Here are some highlights:

- **Persistent memory** lets your subagent retain memory across conversations. This is great if you're using it consistently on the same projects.
- **Preload skills** into subagents by adding the `skill` key and listing skills by name. Note that unlike skills in your main conversation, the entire skill is loaded into context here.
